                The first robot I have ever built was one designed to recognize distances
                between objects and avoid them all while moving forward. I used an infared sensor,
                two brushless motors, a motor controler, a servo to swivel the head,
                a circuit board, arduino board, a 12 volt battery pack, and an aluminum frame to 
                build the robot.

                I had once buit an Electro Magnetic Pulse generator
                able to generate around 1,000 teslas of alternating
                pulsing electromagnetic feilds. I had used a miniture
                high voltage pulse generator able to produce up to 
                500,000 volts of elecrteicity from a 12 volt DC battery
                pack. I hooked it up to a coil of copper wire along with a
                spark gap to act as a capacitor. To focus the feild produced 
                by the coil I used an aluminum cone since recent studies 
                have shown that a cone is most efficient in focusing an
                electromagnetic feild.

                For an engineering class I hooked up multicolord
                LEDs to a circuit board and programmed them to
                light up with a song I played on my homemade speaker. 
                I had to make the speaker myself out of cups, magnets
                and copper wires. I also had to write the program to 
                make the song myself, painstakingly converting piano notes
                to Hertz and millisecond pauses.
