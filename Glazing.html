                The first job I have ever done was replacing a wood window that 
                had rotted out of its frame. <br>With the window in such a condition
                it was a pain getting it out of the frame along with the clean up. <br>
                But in the end with the help of my father we were able to install and 
                seal up a new one making it as good as new.

                The hardest window I have ever replaced was one that 
                was considerably high up in Hotel Park city. It was also
                the biggest window I have ever replaced so we had to rent 
                a lift to install the window. It took us 6 hours to completely
                install and seal.

                The easiest window I have ever replaced was a 
                relatively small vinal window that took only about 
                30 minutes to replace. With only spray foam and a 
                wood frame keeping it in, it took the least amount 
                of effort to complete.
